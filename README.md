**Project Description:**

	The Project entitled "Advanced Health Care Management System With Security Features" is a Web Application   
        mainly designed for patients of a Multi-specialty hospital to reduce their treatment fees and simplify 
	the process of payment. This Project provides a facility to register and Login into the Application. 

	Only registered users are allowed to login into this project system. Once the patient is registered, 
        the admin will allocate a smart card number to the particular patient. The patient has to pay some 
	amount to get a smart card then the details of the patient along with the amount paid by the patient 
        will be stored in the hospital database. Whenever the patient tries to pay treatment fees using a 
	smart card number, he or she will receive OTP to their mobile number and he or she will get a 5% discount on treatment fees.

	The main advantage of this project is that the patient can take treatment in any branch of that hospital 
	and the amount will be deducted from his/her account by sending OTP to their mobile phone and email ID. This 
	project also provides a facility to store patient and doctor details. Patients can access the doctor's profile.
        Doctors can access their patient details. Patients can make online appointments with a particular doctor at 
	a hospital. Patients do not need to bring money to the hospital because of having smart card facility. 
        This Project is developed using Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as Frontend and Mysql as Backend.
